### 3. 📊 customer churn analysis using python

- Cleaned and preprocessed Telco churn dataset using pandas.
- Explored key churn drivers like tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
- Used correlation analysis and grouped visuals for numeric vs. categorical insights.
- Built visualizations (bar, pie) to communicate churn patterns clearly.

**insights**
Insights – Customer Churn Analysis

- Churn Rate: Out of ~7,043 customers, 26.54% have churned (1869 customers).
- Tenure: Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn; long-term customers are relatively loyal.
- Monthly Charges: There is a positive correlation between higher monthly charges and churn → customers paying more per month tend to       leave faster.
- Total Charges: Negatively correlated with churn → customers who have spent more overall (longer tenure) are less likely to churn.
- Contract Type: Customers on month-to-month contracts showed the highest churn rate.
  Customers with 1-year or 2-year contracts had significantly lower churn.
- Technical Support: Lack of tech support is correlated with higher churn → customers with no support churn more often.
- Churn Distribution: Pie chart shows a clear imbalance — majority customers didn’t churn (≈73.5%), but the churned group (≈26.5%) is       still significant.
